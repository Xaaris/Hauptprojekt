This project has shown that the versatility of a CNN combined with the speed of heuristic methods is a viable approach to license plate detection.
It is hard to find up-to-date labeled datasets on which to test this prototype, especially as the goal of this system is not to extract the numbers and letters from the license plates as is in most other systems.
The results of my limited testing though are promising and lead to the conclusion that it is possible to achieve high enough accuracy to base a rough speed estimation on it.
This prototype leaves a lot of room for further improvements and it will be interesting to see what final accuracies can be accomplished.
