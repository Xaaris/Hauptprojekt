# Car Detection
YOLOv3 is used as an object detector. 
It is restricted so just some types of objects, namely cars, trucks and buses.
You can choose between two versions of the network, the normal one and the tiny version which is a lot faster but has a reduced accuracy.
To switch between the two models just comment/uncomment the lines in the YOLO constructor in yolo.py to use the appropriate weights and anchors.
